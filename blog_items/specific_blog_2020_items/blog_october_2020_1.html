            <h2 class="card-title">Welcome to my first Internet Blog!</h2>
            <p class="card-text text-left">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world at this time is currently undergoing some massive changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic unfortunately brought a lot of negative news to a lot of folks
			in different parts of the world. Some of these negative news resulted in COVID-19 related deaths and job losses. I am grateful that I have not been afflicted by COVID-19 
			this time of writing, but everyone has been affected in some way or another by this pandemic.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way how the pandemic affected in my livelihood was that it dried up the job market by a large margin. I am seeking for a full-filling and independent employment but to succeed in this is to establish an employment
			relationship that provides an income higher than a cost of living. However, jobs within my physical reach have degraded in terms of quality, which resulted in not willing to provide a living wage.
			This is not acceptable to any job seeker willing to provide for more than just one person the classic "American dream".<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I am not willing to give up in terms of job hunting and occupational skills. The plus side of this pandemic is that it has provided me free time in developing projects
			by my own two hands. I am in fortunate situation where I'm able to provide for myself for a short time-frame. <br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I've studied within Computer Science throughout my years, I have decided to put some of that
			dedication to work. To start, I've decided to create <b>my portfolio site.</b> Sure, in this day and age, it is expected for a developer to have a portfolio site of some kind, whether it'll be just a LinkedIn Page or a full-fledged business site.
			But for me, it's a great start because a majority of my years, I've spent juggling with studying at academic institutions and working jobs. <br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I've fallen in the odd-ball category of being "too rich and too poor" at the same time, I had to provide
			funding for my own studies out of my own pocket. Thus, I've focused more on working for money than exceeding my academic expectations by creating a lot of C.S. projects. Now that I have more free time under my belt, I've decided to showcase not only my C.S. skills online but of myself. I hope you do enjoy my online contents.
			<br><br><hr style="border: 1px solid grey;">
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have developed some questions that you may potentially ask me and I've provided some answers below regarding my website.<br><br>
			<b>Why did I use a pre-built website template for my portfolio site?</b><br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've used a pre-built website template instead of building completely from scratch, based on some experiences that I have during my job searching. There's some employers that expect you to "start the ground running" if hired by them. 
			What I mean by this is that there's technologies that are currently being used by others and they want you to start working after minimal or no job training without much 'hiccups'. By using a website template that was shared online, I've decided to understand and learn how the template works
			and began adding my own contents and quirks.<br><br>
			<b>Why did I use IFRAMES instead of X content switching processes?</b><br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had some options of using X content switching processes before I've added some serious efforts to developing my site. However, I have chosen to use IFRAMES for one reason: <b>"K.I.S.S."</b> 
			This acronym is short for "Keep it simple, silly" and it's basically a reminder to not complicate things if they can be done simple. Sure, IFRAMES have their ups and downs but using IFRAMES has allowed me to keep some website development simple.
			This is also why you don't see a lot of modern flashy animations, pop-ups, etc. things that we've taken for granted nowadays on my website.<br><br>
			<b>Why did I divide content into sub-menus?</b><br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intention for this content divisions was that I've noticed that a lot of social medias allow you to consume large amounts of contents by scrolling down, down, down... and then you'll find yourself deep down in the rabbit hole.
			It might sound unconventional but the result of dividing the contents into sub-menus forces you to be conscious of what you're clicking on and reading. <br><br>
			<b>What do you think of website development?</b><br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer to learn by trying things with my own hands and seeing things change or break apart. At first, I thought the idea of making a website was easy and comforting, but I was later convinced that it was too complicated.
			Throughout the years, I've grown to accept certain aspects of developing C.S. products as how they are, no matter how complex they are. 
			Website design is a great way to learn some things and seeing what kind of C.S. concepts carry over to this aspect. Now that I have time to develop things on my free time while searching for full-time employment, I've developed this site and 
			I've learned to enjoy website design and carry on with my goals while showcasing some of my efforts online. <br><br>
			<b>I've heard of HTML before. Is HTML a programming language?</b><br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it's not a programming language.<br><br>
			<b>What will you do now after developing most of your site?</b><br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been inspired by online content creators to not only create video content but to pursue free-lancing in my free time. Perhaps this is the right time to pursue a larger online presence and help me to come out of my 'shell' and
			learn something new. I hope to deliver more content to you to enjoy at a later date! Stay tuned for more updates!.
