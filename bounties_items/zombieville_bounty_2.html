			As said before, ZombieVille [1997] is a DOS game that was released by <a href="http://www.psygnosis.org/games/zombieville/" target=_top>Psygnosis</a> in an uncompleted state. 
			It is considered abandon-ware as the game received negative initial reception and forgotten through the years.
			<br>
			There's little to no coverage online of this MS-DOS game as of today, even with videos! The following video is a YouTube playlist that showcases game-play of ZombieVille 1997...in 2020! 
			<br><b>More than 20 years since its release date!</b>
			</p>

				<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style>

				<!--End specified content here-->
			
			<!--Insert more context here-->
			<p>
			As seen in the embedded Youtube playlist of the game, one can see that the game-play is not entirely complete.
			It only reaches up to a certain point because ZombieVille was designed to zombify Matt Black to the point to force a <span><b>GAME OVER</b></span> 
			if Matt Black was ever hit by a zombie. 
			<br>
			However, it's not made clear if zombies have the power to zombify by meleeing you <b>AND
			WITH THEIR BULLETS.</b> Not only that but the reason why the videos were split into multiple parts was because ZombieVille has the
			tendency to <span style = "color:#C31400;"><b>CRASH TO DESKTOP</b></span> at random times.
			<br>
			However, one guaranteed method to crash the game is to shoot down certain NPC's at certain times. For certain NPC's, <span style = "color:#C31400;"><b>the game will
			crash outright.</b></span> However for some NPC's, the game will spawn zombies around Matt Black for the intent of killing Matt fast! If you kill these
			zombies before they kill you, the game will immediately crash to desktop, as it seems that the game wasn't programmed to handle this exception.
			<br>
			I believe that the reason for this exception not programmed in was either of the following:
				<ul>
					<li>Time constraints may have not allowed this situation exception to be taken account of.</li>
					<li>Zombies emmit a lot of blood particles upon death (to hide the design choice of body sprites disappearing on the fly.
						Having too many blood particles will probably slow down the game to a crawl.
					</li>
					<li>Or time constraints may have not allowed to have the engine handle a large amount of zombies on screen at any scene.</li>
				</ul>
			<br>
			Also, I do believe that zombies have the rare chance of dropping antidotes since they do drop medkits, but I haven't seen this happen in 2020.
			<br>
			</p>
		
			<p><u>
			The bounty is that I would like a long-play of Zombieville 1997.
			</p></u>

			<!--Bounty Reward goes here-->
			<b>
			<p>This bounty is set to:<span style="color:#00cc00"> $ USD</span> For submitting videos showcasing the long-play of the game.<br>
			BONUS: Showing the process of how it was done. <span style="color:#00cc00"> +$ USD</span>
			</p></b>
			<!--End Bounty Reward-->
			
			<!--Reason for this bounty-->
			<p>
			The reason why I have requested this bounty is because for the following reasons:
				<ul>
				<li>Documentation and archiving items from the past</li>
				<li>Appreciation of efforts within materials, regardless of the reception</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<!--End Reason for this bounty-->
			
			<!--Conditions for the bounty-->
			<p style ="text-align:left;">
			In regards to this bounty, I am requesting the following to be taken into account:
				<ul>
					<li>No voice or text commentary on the videos.</li>
					<li>If you want to watermark the video, please add small and non-intrusive water mark(s).</li>
					<li>You'll be credited for your long-play video.</li>
					<li>If possible, please combine multiple recorded videos into one. If not, that's okay.</li>
					<li>The long-play will be posted on YouTube whether through your account or mine.</li>
					<li>If you have the sound settings to play general MIDI, you will not be able to record music during your game-play.
						<br><u>If you do use settings to play general MIDI, that's okay as music can be captured with the help from the successful game-play.</u>
					</li>
					<li>There exists a walk-through for this game, but I find it incomplete as it doesn't document everything from the game.
						<br><u>You can find the walk-through <a href="http://www.psygnosis.org/games/zombieville/reviews/walkthrough.txt" target=_top>this link.</a></u>
					</li>
					<li>Please do not skip character dialogues with Spacebar unless you've already conversed with them before.</i>
					<li><u>The reasons for not skipping the dialogues are to:</li> 
					<li>Preserve character dialouge as the voice actors may have not seen their works used in game before.</li>
					<li>Experience the humor written from the 1990's.</li>
					</u></li>
				</ul>
			This is for keeping the video as straight forward as possible and enjoyable for others as well.
